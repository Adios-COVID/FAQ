Introduction
Our team has learned a lot the past few years, about helping you stay healthy; about protecting your family and community from COVID-19. 
We are now ready to move forward with a new direction - virtual clinics - that helps you connect with care in your community.

About Adios COVID
Adios COVID is an all volunteer project. It's lead by Dr. Leo Morales and Frank Martinez.
Our mission is to facilitate the vaccination and wellness of all Latinos in Washington state; by partnering with grassroots Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and similar organizations throughout the state; to conduct outreach and organize wellness resources for Latino communities.
It's a multidisciplinary collaboration with volunteers from the Center for Latino Health, University of Washington Information School, and other individuals from the Seattle area who align with the mission.

Impact
Our reach has been statewide (Washington) for COVID-19 vaccination events (pop-ups) including distribution of free rapid tests.
We've also been able to successfully pilot a free test-to-treat program that's been adopted by Washington Department of Health.
And, we've launched the first study of Long COVID among Latinos in collaboration with SeaMar Commnunity Health Center, Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, and the Allen Institute for Immunology.
